Applications developed with the Thinkwise Software Factory can be authorised with the help of the Thinkwise Intelligent Application Manager.

User groups can be created, to which users can be added. These groups can be assigned to roles. These roles are provided with a set of rights as is further explained in chapter 3. In addition, it is possible to define preferences for users and for user groups, such as layout, menu and prefilters.

Users get one user interface via the Intelligent Application Manager with which they can access all applications for which (via an users group) they are authorised. In addition, they can define their own user interface by means of user preferences.

The structure of this manual follows the same structure as is also specified in the Intelligent Application Manager. By following this structure an application is configured step by step and made available for the end user.
