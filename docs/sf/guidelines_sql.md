title: SQL formatting guidelines
sidebar_label: ðŸ“– Guidelines

There are many good ways to format SQL code. At Thinkwise every software factory developer must format SQL code in the same way. In this section you will find guidelines to do this.
Advantages are

1. A clear structure
   - This makes the code less complex
   - The quality becomes higher
2. A recognizable layout
   - Code is easier to maintain
   - Developers who are working with SQL for the first time can immediately write SQL according to these guidelines and no longer have to create a style themselves.

In this document you will find guidelines per SQL topic. Each guideline is then clarified with an example.

## SELECT

### Guidelines

1. Align left
   - SELECT
   - FROM
   - WHERE
2. Place commaâ€™s in the select in front
3. Give every column in the select an alias. Align AS under each other.
4. Give each table in the FROM clause an alias (without AS).
5. FROM: The alias = first letter of the table + first letters after every _. If this is not sufficient, then add a number or choose another meaningful alias.
6. Place nog empty lines inside a query.

### Example

```sql
select si.sales_invoice_id as sales_invoice_id
      ,si.customer_id      as customer_id
      ,si.invoice_date     as invoice_date
      ,getdate()           as due_date
      ,si.amount_excl_vat  as amount_excl_vat
      ,si.amount_incl_vat  as amount_incl_vat
      ,si.invoice_status   as invoice_status
from sales_invoice si
```

## ORDER BY

### Guidelines

1. Align ORDER BY left under SELECT
3. Place columns in the ORDER BY under each other, left aligned
2. Put commaâ€™s in the ORDER BY in front

### Example

```sql
select si.sales_invoice_id as sales_invoice_id
      ,si.customer_id      as customer_id
      ,si.invoice_date     as invoice_date
      ,getdate()           as due_date
      ,si.amount_excl_vat  as amount_excl_vat
      ,si.amount_incl_vat  as amount_incl_vat
      ,si.invoice_status   as invoice_status
from sales_invoice si
order by si.customer_id
        ,si.invoice_date
```

## WHERE

### Guidelines

1. Align the WHERE left with SELECT and FROM.
2. Align AND right under the WHERE.
3. Align OR left on a new line, under the first column of the previous line.
4. Always put parentheses around OR conditions. The conditions inside the parentheses are idented 4 spaces.
5. = signs are aligned under each other.

### Example

```sql
select si.sales_invoice_id as sales_invoice_id
      ,si.customer_id      as customer_id
      ,si.invoice_date     as invoice_date
      ,getdate()           as due_date
      ,si.amount_excl_vat  as amount_excl_vat
      ,si.amount_incl_vat  as amount_incl_vat
      ,si.invoice_status   as invoice_status
from sales_invoice si
where si.invoice_date = '2019-1-1'
  and si.customer_id  = 15
  and (
          si.invoice_status = 1
          or
          si.invoice_status = 2
      )
```

## Calculated columns in queries

### Guidelines

1. Place calculations in the SELECT on one line, unless the calculation is to complex.

### Example string concatenation

```sql
select e.last_name + ' ' + e.first_name  as name
      ,e.email                           as email
from employee e
```

### Example calculation with numbers

```sql
select si.sales_invoice_id                      as sales_invoice_id
      ,si.amount_incl_vat - si.amount_excl_vat  as vat
from sales_invoice si
```

## CASE expressions

### Guidelines

1. Align CASE and END left, under each other.
2. Ident WHEN and ELSE 4 spaces to the right, aligned left, under each other.
3. Place THEN to the right of WHEN. If possible, on the same line.
4. Align THEN under each other.

### Example Simple CASE

```sql
select so.sales_order_id   as sales_order_id
      ,case so.order_status
           when 0 then 'not_approved'
           when 1 then 'approved'
           when 2 then 'sent'
           else        'delivered'
       end                 as order_status
from sales_order so
```

### Example Searched CASE

```sql
select so.sales_order_id   as sales_order_id
      ,case
           when so.order_status = 0 then 'not_approved'
           when so.order_status = 1 then 'approved'
           when so.order_status = 2 then 'sent'
           else 'delivered'
       end                 as order_status
from sales_order so
```

## JOIN, LEFT JOIN, CROSS JOIN

### Guidelines

1. Align the JOIN left aligned under the first table of the FROM. Align ON and AND right under the JOIN. Don't use the word INNER.
2. Align the LEFT JOIN left under the first table of the FROM. Align ON and AND right under the LEFT. Don't use the word OUTER.
3. Align = signs under each other.
4. Inside a JOIN: Place the columns of the last joined table on the left of the equal-sign. Place the other columns on the right side.
5. Align the CROSS JOIN left under the first table of the FROM.

### Example JOIN

```sql
select p.description     as project
      ,sp.name           as sub_project
      ,h.number_of_hours as number_of_hours
from project p
     join sub_project sp
       on sp.project_id = p.project_id
     join hour h
       on h.project_id     = sp.project_id
      and h.sub_project_id = sp.sub_project_id
```

### Example LEFT JOIN

```sql
select p.description     as project
      ,sp.name           as sub_project
from project p
     left join sub_project sp
       on sp.project_id = p.project_id
```

### Example CROSS JOIN

```sql
select p.description     as project
      ,sp.name           as sub_project
from project p
     cross join sub_project sp
```

## UNION and UNION ALL

### Guidelines

1. Align UNION and UNION ALL left under SELECT.
2. The are no empty lines between UNION and the two queries.

### Example

```sql
select si.sales_invoice_id     as sales_invoice_id
      ,'Approved'              as status
from sales_invoice si
where si.invoice_status = 1 --Approved
union all
select si.sales_invoice_id     as sales_invoice_id
      ,'Not Approved'          as status
from sales_invoice si
where si.invoice_status = 0 --Not approved
```

## FUNCTIONS

### Guidelines

1. Put the function call, including parameters, on one line. When there are too many parameters, the parameters are left aligned on the next line under each other and idented 4 spaces.

### Example FUNCTION with few parameters

```sql
select si.sales_invoice_id                         as sales_invoice_id
      ,si.invoice_date                             as invoice_date
      ,si.due_date                                 as due_date
      ,datediff(day, si.invoice_date, si.due_date) as number_of_days
from sales_invoice si
```

### Example FUNCTION with many parameters

```sql
select si.sales_invoice_id                         as sales_invoice_id
      ,si.invoice_date                             as invoice_date
      ,si.due_date                                 as due_date
      ,datediff(
                   day
                  ,si.invoice_date
                  ,si.due_date
               )                                   as number_of_days
from sales_invoice si
```

## Group by and having

from project p
     join hour h
       on h.project_id  = p.project_id
group by p.project_id
        ,p.description
        ,h.date
having avg(h.number_of_hours) > 5
```

## Subqueries

      ,(
           select sum(h.number_of_hours)
           from hour h
           where h.project_id = p.project_id
       )                      as number_of_hours
from project p
```

### Example subquery in FROM

```sql
select p.project_id           as project_id
      ,h.number_of_hours

       on h.project_id = p.project_id
```

### Example subquery in WHERE

```sql

from project p
where p.finished   = 0
  and 100         >= (
                         select sum(h.number_of_hours) as number_of_hours
                         from hour h
                         where h.project_id = p.project_id
                     )
```

## Subqueries with IN and EXISTS

### Guidelines

1. Place subqueries in EXIST or IN are placed between parentheses, on the next line and ident them 4 spaces.
2. Align the parentheses under each other.

### Example EXISTS

where exists (
                 select 1
                 from sub_project sp
                 where sp.project_id = p.project_id
             )
```

### Example IN

```sql
select p.description  as description
from project p
where p.project_id in (
                          select sp.project_id

end catch
```

## Procedure call

### Guidelines

1. Place first parameter after the procedure name
2. Place parameters under each other, comma in front
3. Place OUTPUT after parameter, align OUTPUTs with each other

### Example

```sql
exec task_kopieer_project @project_id
                         ,@klant_id
                         ,@datum
                         ,@verwachte_kosten     output
                         ,@verwachte_einddatum  output
```

## Comments

### Guidelines

1. Create comments always with --, not /* and */. When you follow this guideline, you can use /* and */ for debugging purposes.
2. On top of a code template: Describe in comment what the code does.
3. Write comment for every statement.
4. Comments tell what the code does, not what it used to do or what has been changed.
5. Donâ€™t leave old code in comments in your code.
6. IMPORTANT: Never use -- in expression fields and prefilters. Only use /* and */. -- will result in errors.

### Example

```sql
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- In the settings table the field todays_date is set to the date of today
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Is todays_date different from today?
if exists (
              select 1
              from settings i
              where i.todays_date <> cast(getdate() as date)
          )
begin

    --Set field todays_date to today's date
    update i
    set todays_date = cast(getdate() as date)
    from settings i

end
```
