The purpose of this document it to assist you with the development of an end product with the Thinkwise Software Factory. You will learn step by step how to develop, test and document your software end product in this innovative manner. Furthermore you will become acquainted with the underlying Thinkwise concepts.

Some prior knowledge and/or experience with data modeling and programming is desirable but not required to be able to develop an end product with the Thinkwise Software Factory.

The Thinkwise Platform consists of four components:

- Thinkwise Software Factory (SF)
- Intelligent Application Manager (IAM)
- Thinkwise Application Tier (Indicium)
- Thinkwise Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)

The Thinkwise Software Factory is used during the development, test and acceptance phases to develop an end product. The GUIs read in the model so that the user can work with the end product.

When the product is approved, then this is transferred to the production environment. The Intelligent Application Manager administers all models of the applications that are in production. The application administrators can also add authorizations and user preferences with the help of the Intelligent Application Manager.

The presentation for the user is also provided by the GUIs in the production environment. The GUIs are available for Windows, Web and Mobile (smartphone and tablet).




1.  Graphical User Interface

2.  Thinkwise makes use of the Pure Flat icon set from Axialis: http://www.axialis.com/

3.  Relational Database Management System of the end product, for instance, SQLSERVER, DB2 or ORACLE.

4.  Business Process Model and Notation 2.0

5.  A lane is often assigned to a group or department (actor) which is responsible for the steps within the lane.

6.  International Requirements Engineering Board

7.  Software Requirements Specification

8.  Customized screens are built in the development environment of the user interface programming language, such as Visual Studio for C\#. Contact Thinkwise for more information about customized screens.

9.  It is recommended to contact Thinkwise before using an extender contact.

10. This extender has restrictions on the maps component including a restriction of maximum of 2,500 geo locations retrievals pera customer per day.

11. FTP://123.45.56.78: The default value can also be used to set up an ftp ip for existing controls (such as File and File\_upload). The value looks as follows: *ftp://123.45.56.78*. (Note, for the use of FTP a username and password must be given in an object model extender, request more information form Thinkwise Software with regard to this).

12. Not yet implemented, but will be released in a next version of the GUI*s.

13. Online Analytical Processing

14. Triggers are platform specific. Depending on the chosen platform certain combinations are not possible.

15. Dynamic-Link Library
