Via the alternative menu (right click on *Advanced menu*) options and base data are available that are not accessible via the standard menu.

The settings of the Software Factory development environment can be modified in the base data.

## Administration

In this tab it is possible to view overviews of subjects outside the context of the project/version. For example, it is possible to get an overview of all projects, project versions, tables, columns, prefilters, conditional formatting, tasks and reports.

These screens do not use the project version selector and could therefore also be opened from the Web GUI.

## Settings

### Software Factory

#### SF configuration

This component contains a number of default settings for new projects and project versions, such as the database, application logic layer, folder and subname group. Here you can also specify which platforms (Windows, Web, Mobile) must be available by default for new project versions. In addition, you can specify which languages must be added as default to new project versions. Each project version can deviate from this.
